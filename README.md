# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The final submission for my Getting And Cleaning Data Course at Coursera<br>
The dataset is <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">Here</a><br>
<br>
#File Description<br>
The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.<br>

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.<br>

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.<br>

The output of the 5th step is called tidyData.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.<br>
